# Batata - Rust-Based JavaScript-like Language Interpreter

## Overview

Batata is a project that takes its inspiration from one of our two beloved dogs, Batata. This Rust-based interpreter is designed for a language that closely resembles JavaScript. So far, we've successfully implemented the essential components of a compiler, including:

- Lexer: Tokenizes the source code into meaningful chunks.
- Parser: Constructs the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from the tokenized code.
- AST: Represents the parsed code in a structured tree format.

## Why Batata?

Just like MacarenaJS, my other project named after our dog Macarena, Batata aims to honor our four-legged friends and their unique personalities. While MacarenaJS is a web framework, Batata is a compiler with exciting potential.

## What is Batata?

Batata is a compiler that can parse JavaScript-like code. Our initial vision was to create a compiler that translates JavaScript into Rust. However, we are open to future possibilities, such as making it parse "JSX" into the MacarenaJS hyperscript.

## How to Use Batata?

Batata is an ongoing project, and we're continuously working on it to make it better. As of now, it's not ready for production use. However, we encourage you to stay tuned for updates as we develop and enhance this interpreter. Your support and feedback are greatly appreciated! üòÑ

## Contributions

We welcome contributions from the open-source community. If you're interested in helping us improve Batata or have creative ideas for its development, feel free to contribute by creating issues, proposing changes, or submitting pull requests. Together, we can make Batata even more pawesome!
